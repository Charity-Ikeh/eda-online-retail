# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an online retail dataset to understand customer purchasing behaviour, sales trends, and revenue patterns.

The analysis aims to uncover meaningful insights such as monthly sales performance, top customers by revenue, popular products, and overall business trends. These insights can help support data-driven decision-making in a retail business context.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactional data from an online retail business. Each row represents a single transaction, including details such as invoice number, product description, quantity purchased, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.

The data captures customer purchasing behaviour over time and allows for analysis of sales trends, customer value, and product performance.
